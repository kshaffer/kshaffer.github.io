In my previous post, I discussed the importance of licensing educational resources in order to make clear who has what right to do what with those resources. I also hinted at my preference for _open_ licensing for educational and scholarly materials. In this post, I'll explain what an open license is and advocate for the use of an open license for all educational resources.



## What is an open license?



Very broadly considered, an open license would be any license in which an author waives some right(s) that are normally theirs under copyright. Some might hold to a stricter definition of open, requiring certain user or community rights to be preserved, but for our purposes the broader definition is fine.

Before discussing how and why to waive some of those rights, though, we need to be clear what those right are. The University of Texas has a good (open-licensed!) [crash course on copyright](http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu), which describes those rights.



> The Copyright Act gives all authors a set of rights that only they may exercise. These include the right to make copies, to prepare derivative works, to publicly distribute, display and perform the work, and in the case of digital sound recordings, to perform the works over a digital network.

With this short set of rights, you would have near perfect control over your works, in fact, too perfect a control over your works. So, the law provides some breathing room so that the public can benefit from the increased numbers of works that are the goal of the law. To use those works, the public enjoys rights to display their own copies, to lend them or give them away, even to sell them, and to reproduce parts of the works in certain circumstances, even to reproduce the entire work in some cases, as a fair use. For more information about fair use, read [Fair use of copyrighted materials](http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/copypol2.html).

Your rights go on for your entire lifetime, plus 70 more years.



And it is worth noting that these rights belong to an author _whether or not they claim them or include a copyright notice on their work._ That wasn't always the case, but under current law, any fixed created work is copyrighted (not copywritten). (Not every type of work is copyrightable, though. [See this page](http://copyright.lib.utexas.edu/whoowns.html#sort) for more info.)

So an open license, broadly defined, is one in which an author waives one or more of their rights to make copies, derivative works, display publicly, perform, sell, etc. in some or all circumstances.



## Why use an open license?



Why would an author give away one or more of the rights they own under copyright law? I can think of a few reasons why a scholar or an educator would waive some, most, or even all of their rights to the resources they create, which follow below.

_Ideology._ An author, like me, may simply believe that educational resources and scholarly output should be freely available. Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and values from one generation to the next. That knowledge, those skills, and those values belong to the community and should be free. Open licenses seek to ensure that freedom.

Even if you don't agree with that ideology, though, there are other reasons why it makes sense to use an open license.

_Influence/impact on you field._ Since open licenses allow more kinds of uses with less restrictions on the user, open licenses often increase the likelihood that others will make use of the material. There is no guarantee. After all, it may be bad material! Or people may not know about it. But all else being equal, a person is more likely to choose an educational resource that comes with more freedom and/or less financial burden. Thus, an open license makes it more likely that colleagues in your field will make use of your educational resources.

_Money._ This may seem contradictory, but an open license may lead to you making more money. In higher education, particularly in the humanities, authors rarely make money by selling stuff. They make money by being employed by a university. An in the life of a university professor, there are precious few moments when one is able to negotiate for higher pay—that is, when you are up for tenure or promotion. At most institutions, a professor's impact on their field is part of the consideration for their promotion and raise. Whether your institution cares more about educational or scholarly output, the same idea holds: open licenses and easy/open access to your materials means a greater potential for impact on your field, which can translate into greater likelihood for promotion and raise. (N.B. I am going off what I've been told here. I'm starting my second year at a university that doesn't require scholarly output of its professors, so check with your institution's policies before you base your career decisions on my blog posts!)

_Money, again._ Just because you use an open license on a work does not mean that you cannot sell that work in the future. The same is true for open source software. For example, one of the things that attracted me to the Linux operating system was its open license and the freedom (as in beer and as in speech) that it came with. However, I paid $50 for [my first Linux distribution](http://www.opensuse.org/en/). I didn't pay for the software so much; I paid for the manuals and the tech support that came with the paid, boxed version. It was my first time using an OS that didn't come preinstalled, and I wanted that extra support. As another example, I love the free, open source music notation application [Lilypond](http://www.lilypond.org). However, I found a few years ago that it was lacking a feature that I sorely needed and could not code myself. So I paid one of the developers €25 to add it for me. The software was free, but I contracted a programmer to write a new feature and donate it to the free software. Lastly, several years ago I did some contract writing for [Linux Journal](http://www.linuxjournal.com/) and the [Open Source Technology Group](http://ostg.com). My job was to write reviews and how-to articles for users of free, open source software. I made a couple thousand dollars over the space of the year writing these articles—all for software I hadn't created.

All of these examples illustrate principles that can translate into educational resources. I'll just explain the first: offering resources with an open license for free on the internet does not preclude selling it in the future. You have to add some value to the sold version, otherwise people will just download and share the original free version. However, let's say you made a website with text and video for a class. You could repackage that as an iPad-friendly ebook, revise the text, reorganized the content, and put it into a spiffy theme. Then you could sell it in Apple's iBook store. People still have the same rights to use the original material (though you are also free to take it down from your website whenever you want), but they have to pay for the new derivative iBook.

It is also worth noting that when publishers consider a proposal for a book, one of the things they evaluate in determining the size of the advance and marketing efforts put into the book is how well the author's previous book sold. (I've read this in a couple books written by publishing editors.) It is a good indicator of how the next will sell and reflects the existing fan-base that an author has. I've also read that a significant blog or social media audience is an indicator used as well. I haven't experienced this myself yet, but I imagine that if an author has a large user-base for their open-licensed materials, that would also translate into an audience for future traditional publications. So free and open for current resources may mean more money for future resources published more traditionally.



## Which open license?



I believe it is best to use established licenses whenever assigning rights to a work. There are already way too many out there! (especially for software) And it gets confusing fast, both for authors/developers and for users. So don't invent a new one; find an established one that fits your needs. If you go with [Creative Commons](http://http://creativecommons.org), the most popular source of open-content licenses (as opposed to open source software licenses), you get the additional benefit of lawyers having read through and cleaned up the license code for use worldwide.

There are a number of Creative Commons licenses, but some are better than others, and all are better for some purpose than the others. Following are those that I recommend the most highly and the uses I think they suit best.

![](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png)[CC Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)
CC BY–SA is a very permissive license. It allows users to do pretty much anything with the licensed material provided that the user gives attribution to the original creator, and licenses any derivative versions of the work with the same license. This is the license I use most of the time. And if you are familiar with open source software licenses, CC BY–SA is the closest of the open content licenses to the popular GPL software license. CC BY–SA most fits the ideological motivation for open licensing. That is, it ensures that openness does not stop with the original version, but also continues to any derivative versions. It also has a practical benefit. Because it requires creators of derivative versions to use the same license, the original author always has the right to incorporate any improvements that others make back into the original. Thus, it really is a _community_ license: it says, this work belongs to the community, and no one can make a version of it that doesn't belong to the community. It does not preclude commercial uses; but again, the content of any commercial derivatives will always be freely available for use in other formats.

![](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/3.0/88x31.png)[CC Attribution (CC BY)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)
CC BY is the most permissive of the CC licenses. It is like CC BY–SA, with the exception of requiring derivative versions to have the same license. There are two key implications of that difference. First, it means that CC BY material can be incorporated into a wider variety of derivative projects, potentially resulting in greater use and impact on the field. Second, it means that individuals or companies could make derivative versions that the original author and the community have no right to use, modify, or feed back into the original work. It's a good license if your primary goal is to get your stuff (or your name) out there, and it will protect the original version. But it doesn't protect the content and the user/producer community from the content being hijacked and further development of the material becoming proprietary.

![](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nd/3.0/88x31.png)[CC Attribution-No Derivative (CC BY-ND)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0)
This license is just like CC BY except that no user can make a new derivative version. It makes sense for music, and possibly for videos, but probably not for text. Why would you want to deny people the right to improve your educational resource when CC BY–SA will preserve your right to incorporate their improvements in your own version)? And why would you want to deny people the right to customize your educational resource for their particular situation? When I write music for church, however, this is the license I use, since I want to allow churches the freedom to use the music, but not to change the tune, chords, or lyrics.

![](http://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png)[CC Zero (CC0)](http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/)
This isn't really a license. However, if you decide that you want to donate your work to the public domain, it is best to license it with CC0. CC0 is better than just donating a work to the public domain because it gives it public-domain-like status to the work in countries that don't have a "public domain" in their legal system. If you want to just give your materials away and don't care about people knowing they are yours (or about derivative works becoming proprietary), CC0 is the best choice.

I hope this post helped some of you decide how best to share your work! If you have any questions or competing thoughts, I'd love to hear them in the comments.
