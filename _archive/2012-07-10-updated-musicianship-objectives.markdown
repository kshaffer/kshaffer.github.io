I've updated my draft course objectives for the Musicianship (music theory and aural skills) course sequence at CSU. It now contains a few new or edited holistic (high-level) objectives and a full draft of content (lower-level) objectives for students to master en route to the holistic objectives. It can all be found on [my github curriculum site](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum). These are the learning and mastery objectives that will form the basis of my grading for these courses. Specific documents of note on that site are the [master list of objectives](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum/blob/master/musicianshipObjectives.md) for the course sequence, and a [draft syllabus for Musicianship I](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum/blob/master/musi198-syllabus.md) which contains some information about assessment and the assignment of final grades under the criterion-referenced/standards-based system.

I would greatly appreciate any comments for improvement. Also, all materials on the github site (including many to be added later) are provided under a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC-BY), meaning that they can be used and/or modified for any purpose, as long as the derivative versions include an attribution to my original. So feel free to "fork" the project and use these materials in whole or in part for courses outside CSU. If you do, I'd love to hear about it (and note it in my tenure file!).
