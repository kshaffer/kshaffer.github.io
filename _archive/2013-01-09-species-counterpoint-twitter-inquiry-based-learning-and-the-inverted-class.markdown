We had fun in Musicianship yesterday. Well, we have fun a lot of days, but I particularly enjoyed myself. It was our first day of our unit on species counterpoint (a form of strict musical composition that strips away many complicating factors like instrument, harmony, form, even rhythm, to allow students to focus on basic issues of melody and combining melodic lines). In the past, I've always followed the lecture-then-homework model for counterpoint, but this year I have inverted/flipped the musicianship course. There is no lecture. Instead, most of class involves students sitting at keyboards in pairs analyzing, singing, or composing melodies and counterpoint exercises.

That change is exciting enough, especially seeing how well it is working compared to last year's lecture (at least so far!). But we tried something else yesterday. Based on ideas I've heard and read from [Ramsey Musallam](http://www.ramseymusallam.com), I decided to take an _inquiry-based_ approach. Instead of giving them a lecture, reading, or video first, I gave the students two pages of model melodies and asked them to analyze them. Only after they analyzed them deeply, did I give them the rules and guidelines for a strict species counterpoint melody (called a _cantus firmus_).

I combined this approach with an idea that came out of a Twitter discussion with [Christopher Long](https://twitter.com/cplong) a few weeks ago, after he gave a [lecture at Catholic University](http://www.personal.psu.edu/cpl2/blogs/TheLongRoad/2012/11/twitter-community-and-the-firs.html) with a projected Twitter stream of student responses. The idea was to have students tweet, rather than take notes individually, and archive the tweets as the class "notebook" for the day. It worked really well, and we're keeping up the practice for a little while to see if it's worth being a more permanent way of doing things.

Here's how the process went yesterday morning:

Students were given a [page of model cantus firmi](http://kshaffer.github.com/musicianshipResources/Graphics/counterpoint/cantusFirmi.pdf) to sing with a partner (and with the assistance of the keyboard, if necessary). After singing a few of them, they were asked to start tweeting any patterns they noticed. They were not allowed to tweet anything that a classmate had already tweeted. Here are the results from the first class:

<script src="//storify.com/krisshaffer/cantus-firmus-1.js"></script><noscript>[<a href="//storify.com/krisshaffer/cantus-firmus-1" target="_blank">View the story "Cantus Firmus (1)" on Storify</a>]</noscript>

After this exercise, I then gave them [my resource explaining the characteristics of a good cantus firmus](http://kshaffer.github.com/musicianshipResources/cantusFirmus.html) and asked them to discuss with their partner (and then with the whole class) what they and the rest of the class got right and what they missed. As you can see if you visit the resource (or are familiar with species counterpoint), they did a really good job of figuring out the "rules" from analyzing a dozen or so exemplars. There were some mistakes, or ideas in need of refinement, but pretty good for a first shot, I think.

After the whole-class discussion, I sent them back to their partnerships to compose two cantus firmi of their own (one in major, and one in minor). The course objective they need to pass for this part of the unit is to compose _and sing_ an idiomatic CF in major and in minor with a partner (and satisfy me that they both understand the choices they made). By the end of the class several had already achieved this. By the end of today's class, everyone had passed major, and most had passed both major and minor.

Musallam calls this inquiry-based process _explore-flip-apply_ (flip being his word for video-based direct instruction). I have presented it to my students as _analyze–access–assimilate–apply_ (access referring to accessing information—I was really just going for the alliteration at this point—and assimilate being Eric Mazur's term for moving from information retrieval to conceptual understanding).

I really like this process, assuming it continues to work. (Note that it did _not_ work when I tried dumping minuets in front of my Musicianship III students last semester, who had not been warmed up to this process—or even the inverted class—from the beginning.) First, at least in this initial melody-writing stage, it gets the students to the _apply_ phase in the same amount of time as lecture–homework (maybe quicker), but with noticeably better average results. Second, the students get to that point without much in the way of direct instruction. That is, I offer them expert guidance and correction as they work through the process of learning a new skill/style themselves, rather than expert instruction at the outset. This is an important process for them to learn, if this class is to serve them for more than just the beginning of their careers. Third, it gets them used to using non-expert peers to help in the learning process, which also prepares them for the "real world." And lastly, by tying performance both to the _analysis_ and to the _application_ phases, they learn to tie theory and practice, performance and composition. (Not to mention the fact that a good melody is, in part, a singable melody. Having them sing as they analyze and compose eliminates a lot of silly compositional errors that come from paper-and-pencil-only work. And, of course, they are improving their singing and sight-reading as they "do theory.")

I didn't have the gumption to follow [Peter Schubert](https://www.youtube.com/user/peterschubertmusic) whole-hog and have my students _improvise_ species counterpoint this semester. However, I think the inverted, inquiry-based approach, and the collaborative aspects of partner work and whole-class Twitter "note-taking" are a big improvement over my lecture–homework–demo–homework approach last year.

And one last added bonus: we all get a big laugh as students' phones or computers begin to "learn" theory along with them. Autocorrect, for instance, doesn't know what a "cantus" is:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>A good cactus firmus is within comfortable range for a singer.<a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23musi199">#musi199</a></p>&mdash; Amanda Larkin (@amndlrkn111) <a href="https://twitter.com/amndlrkn111/status/288689150373265408" data-datetime="2013-01-08T16:50:31+00:00">January 8, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And when a former student sees what's happening and gets in on the action

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>A good cantus firmus starts on fi and ends on re and is all in leaping 6ths. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23musi199">#musi199</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Hagan (@scubadivingzoo) <a href="https://twitter.com/scubadivingzoo/status/288689154500485121" data-datetime="2013-01-08T16:50:32+00:00">January 8, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

we get to laugh at ourselves a bit more. And species counterpoint definitely needs that!
