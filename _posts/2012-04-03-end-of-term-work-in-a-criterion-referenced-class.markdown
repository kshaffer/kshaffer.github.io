As we enter the last few weeks of the semester, it is now time for students to take stock of where they are and where they want to be before final grades are established. It's also time for me to took at where the class is and either chase down individual students who need some prodding or tutoring, or adjust the course plan to help the class as a whole fix something that is more universally sub-standard.

In the past, using a holistic, average-based grading system, this meant answering lots of student questions about what their average grade was, and what grades on subsequent assignments would pull it up to whatever their desired target grade was. It also meant making sure that I was putting out enough assignments to average meaningfully with the frequent, shorter assignments given out early in the semester. Last semester, it also meant a lot of pleading with students about not skipping assignments, reminding them how much of the final grade they were each worth. And, sadly, it meant telling students that it was now mathematically impossible for them to reach their target grade or even to pass. As far as changing the plan of the course, it primarily meant making sure that class meetings hit what was necessary to get students through the final exam successfully.

What is noticeably absent from this list is a taking stock of where there are gaps in student understanding, relative to the course objectives or relative to the elements that must be in place to be properly prepared for the next semester in the course sequence. This semester, though, that is exactly what I'm focusing on at the end of the semester. Because my grading criteria are exactly my course objectives, and because students need a passing grade for all of them (or almost all of them, I decided for Theory and Aural Skills II), helping the students pass the course means directing attention to those gaps in understanding. My grading system prevents me from just getting them to score high enough on the last few homeworks and the exam. If students are failing categories not covered on those assignments, they will still fail. On the other hand, if I want to bring the numbers up and get students above the passing mark, I have to provide special instruction for the topics in which the class as a whole is doing the most poorly.

To do this, I have a spreadsheet with each student's running score for each category. At the bottom of each column is the class median score and the number of students with passing and failing grades in each category. I've noticed a couple categories that a number of students are failing that I had planned to have completed studying by now. Those are getting some extra focus in class and on assignments right now, at the expense of topics I planned to spend more time on but which are currently less of a struggle for my students. For instance, there is still some fogginess about functional bass analysis and prolongation. So as we do bass-line dictation exercises and transcription practice, we're talking more about harmonic syntax that I had planned, especially in the section that is already doing well dictating the bass pitches.

This lack of focus on numbers and averages, and this lack of concocting assignments or weighting schemes to ensure an even distribution of topics in the final grade are incredibly freeing. I also feel like I'm serving my students better by focusing on filling in gaps in their understanding. It's clearer to them that understanding is the goal, not the grade. I also hope that this focus will mean things going smoother next semester, as my Musicianship III students will be better prepared for the material.

Considering all that, I am very happy to have gone with this grading system this semester rather than the traditional holistic, average-based system I've used in the past. I believe it serves my students better, the objectives are clearer, and it frees me to focus on what's most important.
