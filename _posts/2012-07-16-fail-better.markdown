This past semester, I've discovered a wonderful, supportive group of teachers on Twitter. In particular, there is a thriving community of instructors on many different levels using the "flipped" or "inverted" classroom. (In an "inverted" class, information transfer occurs at home via readings, listenings, and videos, rather than in-class lectures. Class time is then devoted to practice exercises, projects, and small-group discussion, all with the instructor present.) This community has a weekly chat on Twitter (#flipclass, Mondays, 8–9pm). One week, the topic of that chat turned to students' fear of failure. In the midst of that discussion, [Stacey Roshan](https://twitter.com/#!/buddyxo) suggested the need for "supported failure"—a supportive environment in which students are encouraged to try, fail, learn from their failure, and try again. This reminded me of Samuel Beckett's famous line, "Ever tried? Ever failed? No Matter. Try again, fail again, fail better." I used to think he was talking about writing a dissertation! But now I realize that an environment that fosters a willingness to fail is the foundation of any good educational endeavor.

I found quickly last semester how paralyzing the fear of failure can be for my music students. The beginning of their training in musical composition and analysis is species counterpoint, a centuries-old method of composition study that strips away most of the complicating factors and allows the student to focus intently on one or two fundamental musical problems. The first time I gave them an exercise in species counterpoint, I fully expected most students to fail to accomplish all that I asked them to do. With that in mind, I planned on grading the first attempt on effort, and following it with two or three more assignments that focus on the same musical issues and maintain the level of difficulty, grading gradually more strictly over the sequence of assignments. I told my students this plan before the first assignment. 

My students attempted a mutiny.

"We're moving too fast!" (It was the first homework assignment after a unit test.) "I don't know how to do this!" (Of course you don't. We just started!) And no matter how many sports metaphors I gave them (You don't learn how to shoot free throws accurately by listening to a coach tell you what to do; you listen and then _practice!_) and how forgivingly I graded early assignments for each new species, I could not assuage their tension, frustration, and paralyzing fear of doing something they don't yet know how to do. Nor could I get them to look past the grade, to the comments that would help them on the next assignment.

Some of this is their past educational experiences. They are so focused on getting the grade, and getting it _every single time_ that the idea of doing a homework assignment that they don't already know how to do is frightful. The idea of receiving comments on an assignment and using them to improve for the next one (or a redo of the same assignment) is foreign to many of them. Some of it was me. I was the new professor, and the only one teaching music theory and aural skills. The previous instructor did not use species counterpoint. And my last teaching gig was as a grad student instructor in an Ivy League university. So it must be me or the "Ivy League" material that needed to be fixed. Thankfully, the other faculty in my department are great, and they all had my back. We stuck it out, and it was okay. And this semester, my students have been discovering over and over again why we used species counterpoint, and why they had to master it before moving on to other things.

But the big thing here, I think, is that these students are simply afraid to fail. The self-esteem inflation of their early education, the grade-grubbing mentality that has been exacerbated by No Child Left Behind, and the fragile adolescent ego—especially for the young musician—all contribute to this. But what to do about it?

As I've experimented with the flipped/inverted class in music theory this semester, I've found the fear of failure finally starting to disappear.

For example, I introduced my students to voice-leading in pop/rock vocal style (writing one or two harmony parts to accompany the melody in a pop/rock song). There is no textbook that covers this material, so I wrote up five pages of guidelines, made a 25-minute screencast video of me doing an arrangement of a song in the software they would use (purposefully making and correcting a few mistakes), and then had them come to class with their laptops, having read and watched, ready to try one of their own. I then gave them a song with a few really tricky passages and had them work on it in partners as I wandered the room listening and helping. 

A couple interesting things _didn't_ happen. No one left the assignment blank and said, "I didn't get it." They all did something. More importantly, _no one freaked out when I looked over their shoulder and saw mistakes_. It was just understood tacitly that they would try something, it wouldn't work, and they would change it. Perhaps my making and correcting mistakes in the video demonstration contributed to that; perhaps the fact that they were using software that allows them to drag notes around instead of erase and rewrite contributed to that; perhaps the fact that they could complete this assignment in partners and have it count toward their assessment requirements contributed to that. But I definitely think the inverted class format was a key factor, since this has happened on several occasions: doing a project in class, especially in groups, with the instructor basically doing "office hours" for everyone at once, sends the message (paraphrasing Beckett) _try, fail, try again, fail better_ . . . and eventually succeed.

Looking back, I didn't really learn how to fail properly (that is, purposefully) in my academic life until I was working on my dissertation. One can't succeed at any research project of significance without failing along the way (unless you're _really_ lucky). I wish I had learned it sooner. On the other hand, the sports I played growing up _did_ teach me how to fail with a purpose. And interestingly, those sports activities did not result in a grade after every practice—just feedback. Only the major activities (games, meets) had quantifiable results—and the first one only came after a slew of practices. Maybe we could learn a lesson there. And maybe then our students won't have to get a Ph.D. to learn how to fail.
