Interesting things have been happening at CU this week. Conflict has arisen over methods used by sociologist Patti Adler in a course on deviance. Controversy has primarily arisen surrounding a prostitution skit that she has employed in many iterations of this course and the way that administrators have responded to concerns raised. I'm not going to provide any of my own commentary here, but I think it would be helpful to collect and present together many of the articles and statements put out this week. I've heard a lot of misinformation and incomplete information, both of which can be unhelpful, even dangerous. What follows is as complete a picture as I can put together at the moment, and hopefully the juxtaposition of these various statements will help readers to read each statement critically.

Email from Provost Moore to CU-Faculty (This was also a [public press release](http://www.colorado.edu/news/campus/2013/12/16/message-from-the-provost).), Dec. 16, 2013:

> Dear CU-Boulder Faculty, Staff and Students,

> The University has received a number of queries from faculty, staff, students, media and external stakeholders regarding the status of sociology Professor Patti Adler.

> Professor Adler has not been dismissed from the University and is not being forced to retire. Dismissal requires extensive due process proceedings, and the University does not coerce its faculty to retire. She remains a tenured faculty member in sociology at CU-Boulder.

> A number of you have raised concerns about academic freedom and how it may connect to this situation. Academic freedom protects faculty who teach controversial and uncomfortable/ unpopular subjects. However, academic freedom does not allow faculty members to violate the University’s sexual harassment policy by creating a hostile environment for their teaching assistants, or for their students attending the class.

> In this case, University administrators heard from a number of concerned students about Professor Adler’s “prostitution” skit, the way it was presented, and the environment it created for both students in the class and for teaching assistants. Student assistants made it clear to administrators that they felt there would be negative consequences for anyone who refused to participate in the skit. None of them wished to be publicly identified.

> The Dean of the College of Arts & Sciences and the Chair of the Sociology Department determined that Professor Adler would not teach the class in the spring semester (2014). Pending a review by faculty in sociology and in accordance with the needs of the department, Professor Adler may be eligible to teach the course in the future.

> To reiterate, Professor Adler has not been fired or forced to retire. As to comments she has made that she might be fired in the future, I should note that any employee at the University – including faculty members – found responsible for violating the University’s sexual harassment policy, is subject to discipline up to and including termination.

> The University fully supports the teaching of controversial subjects, and the ability of faculty to challenge students in the classroom and prompt critical thinking. At no time was the subject of Professor Adler’s course in question. Rather, it was the manner in which the material was presented in one particular classroom exercise and the impact of that manner of presentation on teaching assistants and students.

> Russell L. Moore, Provost  
University of Colorado Boulder

Email from Chancellor DiStefano to CU-Boulder faculty, Dec. 19, 2013:

> At the University of Colorado Boulder, we can achieve our educational mission only in an atmosphere of free inquiry and discussion, where our students and faculty pursue their study, learning, research, and discussions with true academic freedom. It is also crucial to this freedom of inquiry, that we are equally dedicated to providing a working and learning environment free from harassment and discrimination. These two primary objectives – academic freedom and providing a positive and challenging working and learning environment – can successfully coexist. We know the faculty of this great institution is dedicated to achieving both. When questions do arise, we are dedicated to working through them in accordance with the principles of shared governance. Our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering.

I hope that is helpful to those of you keeping track of the story. I'll update this as the opportunity arises. Please let me know if I missed anything important.
