In the article "From Knowledgeable to Knowledge-able," (published in the the section on [Hacking Teaching](http://www.digitalculture.org/hacking-the-academy/hacking-teaching/) in crowdsourced ebook, _Hacking the Academy_), Michael Wesch argues that professors should not teach _subjects_ but instead should teach _subjectivities_. While I don't agree that we should teach subjectivities _instead_ of subjects, I do agree that there are general frameworks for thinking about the world and their work that we should try to instill in students. I also agree that these things can't be "taught" in the sense of information delivery, but must be cultivated through active engagement and practice. (Of course, that's the best way to teach most things!)

So as I've started thinking about next year, here are the "subjectivities" that I would like to instill in my students.




  * I am an adult.  
  * I am responsible for my own education and my professional and personal development.  
  * Education is more than job training.  
  * Where education _is_ job training, it is training for 2060 as much as for 2016.  
  * I am (or should become) a creator, not merely a consumer.  
  * Music is both an art and an area of humanistic study.  
  * Scholarship is both individual/private/introspective and collaborative/social.  
  * Musical expertise is a function of hours spent performing musical skills. (courtesy of Mitchell Ohriner)



This is not a complete list, just what I'm thinking at the moment. What else should I add to this list?
