I had a great conversation yesterday with a few other theorists who are using various kinds of flipped teaching techniques. One of them, Philip Duker, gave me an amazing insight. Because the software I use for automated quizzes timestamps each student response, _I can do my timed fundamentals quizzes online, at home!_ No more taking the first five to fifteen minutes of class for those quizzes (though we'll still need to do paper writing quizzes in class). Instead, I can post quizzes and allow students to take them on their own time, and students can request specific quizzes they would like to attempt depending on where they are in terms of their course objective completion. This is going to be a big deal, I think. And I hope it will really help my students by allowing more self-pacing in terms of which quizzes they take when, and in terms of increasing the amount of class time for activities.

Thanks, Phil!
