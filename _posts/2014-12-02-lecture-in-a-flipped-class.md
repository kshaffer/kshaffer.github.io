Lecture has been creeping back into more of my classes lately. 

I've been a big proponent of the "flipped" or "inverted" class model. However, I've been discovering lately that the value of a flipped class is not so much the [geographical flip](http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/shafferpt1.html) (doing at home what is typically done in class, and vice versa), it's [the flip in timing](http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/shafferpt3.html) (explanation first v. activity first).

I'm still maintaining the timing flip in my classes. In a music theory class, students engage, explore, analyze, compose something *before* they get a "lecture." I might give them a task that they are partially ready for, have them attempt to do it by transfering or forming new strategies. Or I might give them difficult questions to answer in the context of a piece of music they are largely unfamiliar with. Then I present a mini-lecture or demonstration *after* they have put substantial effort into that task. 

The "flipped" advantages are still present in this model. Students come to the lecture with a list of questions and difficulties from their own attempts. They also come in with specific knowledge about what they already know how to do, and perhaps some confidence about what new things they were able to figure out on their own or with a peer. And they are less likely to hear my explanation or see my demonstration and think "this looks easy" — because they know better!

The typical advantages of a lecture are also present: Students can interrupt me to ask questions — they can't do that with a book or a video. And I can gauge (visually, or using clicker questions) their engagement and confusion.

But the big advantage combines these two: having wrestled with the material *before* they hear details from me, they are far more equipped to critique, push back, and question my ideas than if I were explaining it first. They also have more investment in those alternative perspectives, since they put time and effort into formulating them, possibly involving some arguments with a peer — or even with themselves. From a critical pedagogy perspective, that's a big win. 

I still try to plan for active student work as much as possible in my classes, as well as to have the most confusing things be things we wrestle with together in person, rather than in isolation at home. However, I'm outgrowing my allergy to lecture. Yes, many lectures are little more than vehicles through which those in authority tell it like it is. But when prefaced by an opportunity for students to form their own convictions, a little extemporaneous lecture at the end, with lots of room for student interruptions, can help many students learn more deeply. It can even help foster student agency.
