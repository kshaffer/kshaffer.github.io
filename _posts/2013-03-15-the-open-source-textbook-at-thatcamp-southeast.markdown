Last weekend, I attended my first [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org) at Georgia Tech. During the first session, I got to demonstrate my [open-source online "textbook"](http://kshaffer.github.com/musicianshipResources) for CSU's Musicianship courses and lead a discussion on open-source educational materials. It was a lively and interesting discussion, and it was followed up with a discussion on open-access publishing led by [Pete Rorabaugh](http://twitter.com/allistelling).

Between the two sessions, a number of interesting points were raised. The best way to share those, I think, is simply to provide the Twitter back channel and Google Doc, since just about every point raised or resource referenced made it into one or the other. If you want to see what was discussed, or of you were present and want to follow up on something shared, here is a Storify archive of the Twitter back channel from my session on the open-source textbook:

And the Google doc for my and Pete's sessions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLbaM9x06ms2drQ5-gzmGY8tH7IM7KKG--r87hSonpM/edit?usp=sharing).

This is a living document, and we welcome comments and additions to it, even now that the conference is over. Open source and open access are major issues in academia, with increasing significance it seems, and this conversation is far from over. Hopefully we can continue to make significant and meaningful contributions to that conversation for the good of our scholarly fields and our students.
