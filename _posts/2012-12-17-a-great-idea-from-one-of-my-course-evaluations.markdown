I received the results of my course evaluations today. Under the "what can the instructor do better" section, one of my Musicianship III students wrote:



> I admire Dr. Shaffer's efforts to encourage students to take charge of their learning with an objective based system. However, I feel that being given a list of objectives and told to strategize a semester-wide plan to accomplish them, even with the offer of office time help, is a bit daunting. I feel it would have been best for the entire class to start out following a sample plan that teacher devises and that covers each type of objective.Each student would have a chance to learn their strengths and weaknesses and devise better practice strategies in a more controlled environment.Then the class could write their own two-three week plan for accomplishing a certain number of objectives. Finally, for the last two months they could be told to formulate their own plan. This way the students still have the responsibility of managing their time to study and practice but with a good example of pacing/planning to follow, their initial strategies are far more likely to succeed.



I really like this idea. I had already planned on dividing the semester into three units for Musicianship II and giving students a set order for some of the objectives within the units. But I like the idea of building independence throughout the semester, as students learn how they can better manage their own education. The reality is that, though they are legally and physically adults, many college students aren't ready to manage this on their own. Such a system that is intentional in the way it progresses from restriction towards freedom could help those students a lot. I'm definitely going to think about how I can work this into my courses more, especially Musicianship I.
