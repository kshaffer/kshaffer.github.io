Lots of professors and teachers are putting together their own curriculum materials these days. The internet makes it easy and cheap (even free), and the _inverted_ or _flipped_ class movement provides significant motivation as well as opportunity to do so. The cost burden that textbooks place on students, and the move away from niche textbooks and competing schools of thought towards one-size-fits-all textbooks make traditional texts less attractive for many as well. So these days, many instructors find themselves making original materials for their courses.

Many instructors, particularly those who are inverting/flipping their course, share their materials online in a public venue. Many flipped-class videos are hosted on YouTube or Vimeo; many instructors post syllabuses or readings on a public blog, their personal website, or a public repository like github. The public nature of these materials, especially if not accompanied by a license or a clear statement about what rights to use and reproduction the author retains for herself, can easily lead to plagiarism, copyright violations, or general confusion about what is legal to do with them. In fact, this confusion and misuse seems to me to be a common trend with web-based resources, moreso than with traditionally published resources. There is an assumption that if something is online, it's public domain. That is, if you can access it for free, you are free to use it as you please.

That, of course, is not the case. Proponents of free/open-source software distinguish between software that is "free as in beer" (no cost) and "free as in speech" (author passes on many of his/her rights to the user). Just because an application is free as in beer, does not mean that it is free as in speech. In fact, most freeware (software that costs no money) is just as closed as paid software in terms of the users' rights. Freely downloadable apps like TweetDeck do not allow the user the right to access the source code, change it, and redistribute the new version. They simply have the right to use the software. On the other hand, open source software like Lilypond, MultiMarkDown, or the Linux operating system give the user the right to manipulate and redistribute the code.

The distinction between these two kinds of "free" is helpful for educational resources as well as software. And the main difference between free-as-in-beer and free-as-in-speech is this: free-as-in-beer protects the rights of the _author_, while free-as-in-speech protects the rights of the _community_.

A second, and perhaps even more important distinction is this: free-as-in-beer means that authors and users are two distinct groups with different rights; free-as-in-speech makes possible a third category of author-users, or producer-consumers.

I personally believe that when it comes to educational resources (as well as scholarly output), free-as-in-speech is the way to go. Educators and scholars are not authors/producers only, nor are they users/readers/consumers only. They are producer-consumers. In fact, I think that's a good definition of what a scholar or a teacher is: someone who interacts with existing knowledge for the purpose of manipulating it and adding to it before passing it on to others. But I will save the open-access ideology for a future post!

Regardless of your ideology on this matter, I believe that it is very important for instructors making their own materials to be clear about licensing their materials. Licensing may seem overly bureaucratic or even nerdy to think about, certainly less interesting than that content. However, it is extremely important for public materials to have a clear statement of the rights passed onto the users. Without that, you are more open to people using your materials in ways you do not want, as well as people using your materials _less_ because they are uncertain whether or not they are allowed to. A simple copyright statement can be enough to do that, or you may lay it out in more detail. (Keep in mind, of course, that no author has the right to restrict any use of their materials that falls under legal guidelines for _fair use_).

Whether your resources are closed or open, public or private, a clear license statement is important, both to protect your rights as the author, and to make it clear what rights you are passing on to others who find your materials. And to the extent possible, using an existing license familiar to people (such as "All Rights Reserved," "Public Domain," or a Creative Commons license) ensures the greatest clarity.

I hope in a future post to walk through some of the more common existing licenses and their implications for those producing resources and those using those resources. For now, I'll just say that I almost always license my course materials with a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license and my software with the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). I'll explain why in that future post.
