_The following is an introduction to criterion-referenced grading for my musicianship students this fall. I'm posting it here, in case it is of interested to others. And, of course, I welcome any feedback you might have!_



Musicianship courses at CSU make use of _criterion-referenced grading_ (also called _standards-based_, _mastery-based_, or _learning-objectives-based grading_). Each course syllabus includes details on how final grades are calculated for each course, but I'd like to provide a more general explanation of what this system is and why we will use it, since it is likely unfamiliar to many of you.





In short, criterion-referenced grading seeks to make final grades line up as much as possible with student mastery of the material and course objectives. The final grade is not an average of grades received throughout the semester, but a measure of how successful the student has been by the end of the semester in reference to the course objectives laid out in the syllabus.





In CSU Musicianship classes, if you achieve each course objective in the syllabus, you will get a minimum grade of a B at the end of the semester. If you achieve most of them, but not all, you will get a C (the exact percentages vary by class, depending on factors outlined in the specific syllabus). If you do not meet the minimum number of course objectives for a C, you will fail the course with a D or F.





Criterion-referenced grading means that much of your work will not "count" towards the final grade, since the only work that "counts" is work that meets one or more of the objectives. It also means that you will get multiple "grades" for many of your assignments, depending on how many course objectives are referenced by the assignment.





This system is designed with two things in mind: first, making sure that passing semester grades in one musicianship course reflect readiness for the next course in the sequence as much as possible; and second, giving you feedback throughout the semester that is transparent and helps you along the way to achieving the course objectives.





I strongly believe that final grades should reflect understanding, mastery, and readiness to go on, not behavior (showing up on time and turning in worksheets) or the ability to play the game of school. I also strongly believe that grades throughout the semester should largely be information—information on where you are succeeding and where you need to focus extra attention or seek help. Criterion-referenced grading does both of those things.





I should note that I did not invent criterion-referenced grading. A lot of research has gone into it, and many instructors on many different levels and in different fields are using it today. (Just see the Twitter hashtag: #sbar, for "standards-based assessment") However, I did design our particular implementation of it. In what follows, I explain the particulars and the philosophy behind it in some detail. Feel free to ask me questions, either in person or in the comments below.





## What an assessment looks like





Some assessments are pass/fail assessments, which are fairly straightforward. I may give an in-class quiz asking you to note whether a series of excerpts I play you are in major or minor mode, noting that you must get 4 out of 5 correct to pass the assessment. If you get 4 or 5 correct, you pass. If you get 3 or less correct, you don't, and you must reassess at some later point. Once you pass that objective (identify major and minor mode by ear), you're done with those quizzes. If any further class time is devoted to that objective, you can either assist your classmates (though not on an assessment, of course) or work on something else independently.





Most objectives will be assessed on a four-point scale: 4 = _mastery_, 3 = _passing_, 2 = _progressing but not passing_, 1 = _failing_, and 0 = _not attempted_. Further, most assignments involve more than one objective. For example, a transcription assignment will be assessed in reference to the transcription objective, as well as the use of music notation software, and possibly your use of analytical symbols (if a harmonic or formal analysis is also required). Each of these will get a "grade" (a number 0–4). Thus your "grade" will look something like this:

> Transcription of Lutheran chorale: 3  
> Use of music notation software: 4  
> Roman numeral analysis of chorale: 2






In such a case, you have met the first two objectives, but not the last. You will have the option to reassess your Roman numeral analysis, and if you choose, the option to reassess the transcription in order to reach mastery (to move the 3 up to a 4).





This may seem confusing at first, but once we get going with assessments, I think you will find that it is _more_ clear than traditional grading. When you see your assessment results, you will know exactly what you have mastered, what you have passed, and what needs more attention.





## Effects and advantages of criterion-referenced grading





In addition to better lining up final grades with student mastery and readiness to go on to the next course, criterion-referenced grading offers some positive effects and advantages in student learning. In other words, not only will your grade better reflect your success at the end of the semester, it will actually help you succeed better than in a traditional grading system.





The main reason that it helps you succeed better is that it directs your efforts away from areas where you have already mastered the material towards areas where you need extra attention. As one student noted last year in a survey I conducted,

> It helped to understand what I was doing well (I used to think I was doing nothing well in aural skills … which can be a bit defeating) and also helped me to understand where I needed to focus my attention.

In fact, I found that overall, using criterion-referenced grading last year allowed me to set a higher standard for success in the course, and at the same time _more students met that standard_.





Further, I have found that students are much less likely in a criterion-referenced system to let weak areas stay weak. Instead, they work to knock off one weak area at a time until all reach a level of mastery. Not only does this mean better learning; it also means better preparation for the next course in the sequence.





Think about it this way: in a traditional system, a student that passes Musicianship I with a low C probably has some areas where they are doing F work, which is balanced out in the final grade by other areas where they have done well. Often the F areas are the harder material, which comes later in the semester, and the A areas the easy material, which comes early in the semester. Guess what. The hard stuff at the end of the semester is _the most important material to master in order to succeed in the following semester!_ Musicianship II doesn't start by building on scales and key signatures (weeks 1–2 in Musicianship I); it starts with relatively advanced dictation, harmonic analysis, and model composition. This builds on the _end_ of Musicianship I. What happens to a student that just barely passes Musicianship I with a weak knowledge of the harder topics in that class? They are _completely_ unprepared for Musicianship II.





How does a criterion-referenced system differ? The way I do it, you must master a minimum percentage of course objectives _in each category on the syllabus_ to pass the class. Thus, even students with a C at the end of Musicianship I have a relatively balanced record of success, with no glaring holes, just a few small ones here and there. Thus, in anything we do in the next semester, the C student is only a little bit behind their classmates. And if that student is motivated enough, they know exactly which areas are worth devoting some time on during the winter or summer break to prepare them not to be behind in the next semester.





The last thing I want to do is set you up for failure. Criterion-referenced grading is a big help for me to help you succeed now, and to ensure that you have what you need to succeed next semester as well.





## Keeping track of assessments





In the past, students were always coming up to me and asking me "what's my average"? I had a complicated spreadsheet full of percentages and formulas that would calculate that for me, so I could respond. Criterion-referenced grading has no "average" grade. In fact, the only letter grade that exists is the final grade. And there are a lot of course objectives to keep track of. How do you know where you're at and what you need to do?





I decided to write my own [gradebook application](http://github.com/kshaffer/gradebook) for these courses. On my computer, I have a database that keeps track of all your assessments, as well as folders for each of you that I will share with you on DropBox. Every time I assess work, I can run my gradebook application, and it will generate reports for everyone, and copy each of your reports into your DropBox folder. The next time your computer is online, it will automatically sync with that folder, and your most recent report will be on your computer without you doing anything. These reports will begin with a summary showing the percentage of objectives you have met for each category on the syllabus. Following that summary will be a breakdown of your assessments listed individually by category. When you look at this report, you will be able to see quickly which categories need the most work, and which objectives in those categories have not yet been met (or attempted). This should make it easy for you to see what you have done, as well as plan what to do next.





## What students think





Perhaps the most interesting thing to see is what past students say about this grading system. Though I have modified my system a bit since then, I surveyed my spring 2012 students regarding their thoughts on criterion-referenced grading. These students took my classes in the fall with a traditional grading system, and then in the spring with a criterion-referenced system. You can read what they had to say about the change [here](/2012/05/student-feedback-on-criterion-referenced-grading/).





I hope this introduction helps you better understand what we'll be doing this semester. Like I said above, it may seem confusing or a big adjustment at the outset, but once we get going, it will be very clear what we're doing, why, and what you need to do.
