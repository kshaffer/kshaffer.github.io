I've now finished a draft of my syllabus for Musicianship IV (#musi299). Like Musicianship II (posted earlier today), the course will be divided into three units of study, each with firm deadlines. I've also finished a draft topic list/grading rubric for the first unit. I'm interested in feedback from fellow theory instructors and students. In particular, will students have a clear idea of the goals they are working toward and what specifically they should be working on at any given moment? And particularly important for this group of students, if a student gets behind, will he/she be able to catch up? Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

The documents are both on my [GitHub curriculum site](https://github.com/kshaffer/musicianship-curriculum).
