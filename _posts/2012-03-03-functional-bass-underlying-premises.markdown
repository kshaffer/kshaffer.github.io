One of the cool things about teaching at CSU is that, as the only theorist in the department, I oversee the theory and aural skills curriculum myself. Of course, I answer to my department chair and don't make any big moves without the general support of my colleagues. However, if I want to shift gears or incorporate newer approaches than those contained in current textbooks, I can do so readily.

One of the newer approaches not found in current music theory texts that I've incorporated is _functional bass_, developed by my dissertation advisor Ian Quinn (a self-proclaimed "neo-McHoseian"), and the theory of harmonic progression that accompanies it. I plan on putting together a few posts in the near future that outline some of the details of the theory and why/how I find it helpful in my teaching and analytical work. In this post, I thought I'd offer a very brief overview of the theoretical premises to those unfamiliar with Quinn's theory (especially important since Quinn has not published any material in print specifically about functional bass and its use in music theory pedagogy).

Quinn's theory of harmony function is rooted in a few fundamental premises:





  * _Chords are collections of scale degrees_ (rather than a root pitch class with stacked thirds above it).  
  * _Each scale degree has its own functional tendencies_—places it tends to come from and places it tends to go. Some of those tendencies are stronger than others, and some are contingent on the presence or absence of other scale degrees in the same chord.  
  * _The member of the chord in the bass (rather than the root) is the privileged member of the chord_—that is, the chord member that determines, predicts, and/or encapsulates the general function of the chord more than the others.  
  * Scale-degree tendencies in classical tonal music tend to group together into three broad functional categories, more or less the three functional categories of Rameau, Fetis, Riemann, et al.: _tonic (T), subdominant (S), and dominant (D)_.



While the differences between some of these premises and those underlying more standard theories of tonal harmony are at times subtle, the differences between Quinn's bass-oriented, scale-degree based theory and the usual root-oriented theory are substantial. I will unpack some of them in future posts. For now, I'll call it a night.

In the next post(s) in this thread, I plan to write about how one gets from scale degrees to function, and from function to _functional bass_. Then I can dive into why a function theory like Quinn's is better than a root-motion theory for _understanding_ (not simply describing) harmonic progressions and the role that a individual chords play within given progressions.
