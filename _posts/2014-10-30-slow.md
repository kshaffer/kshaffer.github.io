There's a "slow church" movement growing lately—one that focuses less on the growing commercialism of the church, the church-as-a-business mindset, in favor of a focus on the slow, gradual growth of ordinary believers.

I really like this idea, and I think it could apply to many areas of life. For instance, I use (and like using) a lot of digital technology. But I find myself wanting to slow down, especially when it comes to reading and writing. Most of my reading ad writing—and my finding of things to read and things to write about—takes place on the computer. Especially Twitter.

Sometimes—often—I really like how fast I can get my thoughts into (digitally) written form. And how easily I can put those ideas in front of others. These are incredible advantages for a researcher and a writer.

However, I find that when I write on paper (as I am doing now), especially when a physically responsive fountain pen and a wood fire are involved (as they are now), my mind moves more slowly. Or rather, the mind-to-paper stream hits a bottleneck. Not everything gets through. And I can use the writing time to evaluate and re-mold my thoughts. The result is a different kind of writing.

I'd hesitate to say that the fast or the slow is better. They are simply different, and I find the diversity valuable.

I also find that because I can read quickly and because I am often crunched for time when reading, I read fast even when I don't have to. I don't linger. I don't mull. Even when I have time, a comfy chair, and a glass of wine.

I need less time with Twitter and more time with Instapaper. Less time online and more time in books. Less note-taking on Twitter and more note-taking in a Moleskine. Less coffee and more wine. All of these things are just fine in themselves—and quite useful. I just need more balance. More slowness.

More mountains?
