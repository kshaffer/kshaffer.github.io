Lately, I’ve been teaching my two-year-old some German. I’m keeping it very low key, since my German skills are pretty rudimentary. However, we think it would be valuable if our kids have at least some basic knowledge of a second language from an early age, and I’m currently working on improving my German. So it’s just natural to include my eager-to-learn, linguistically precocious son on the process!

Mostly, he just knows _bitte_, _danke_, _Ich liebe dich_, and _bis Morgen_. But the other day, I had just finished some study with my audio course, and my two-year-old stole my five-month-old’s blanket to put on his bunny who was “napping.” I said, “Nein! Das ist für [five-month-old]!” He replied, “Das ist für Bunny!” This was his first complete German sentence (I'm counting "Bunny" as a name, and thus, the same in any language), and he knew it! He had this incredible the-gears-are-turning-and-light-bulbs-are-going-off-everywhere look on his face as he realized that he had just done something new without the time to think about it beforehand. That was quite cool.

He has since repeated that same sentence upon stealing that same blanket. He also (knowingly) repeated my question, “Was ist dies?” and a few more words. It’s fun to see him learn, as always, and especially to see his mind so easily segregating English and German (and the little French he’s been exposed to) without skipping a beat. That motivates me to get better at German, so we can have more prolonged conversations. He’s really only held back by my personal deficiencies _auf Deutsch_. And if it does work out for all four of us to go to Basel next summer, he’ll pick it up like crazy if we can establish a good base now. (And maybe our five-month-old, who will be just learning to talk before we go.)
