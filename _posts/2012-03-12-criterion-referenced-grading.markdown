After grading a round of assignments early this semester, I updated grades in my class's online gradebook and emailed my students to notify them of the updated marks. Ten minutes later, a student walked in and said, "Dr. Shaffer, I noticed that I have a zero in the gradebook for notation software. Is that because I turned the last figured-bass assignment in by hand instead of typesetting it?" "Yes," I answered. She then told me about the issues she was having with her notation program, which we addressed so that she could get the assignment in for full credit in the notation software category. All this happened in a short time (within an hour of uploading the grades), and before the next class meeting when I planned to hand back assignments to the students.

Things were not this way last semester! Last semester, I calculated students' overall grades using a weighted average of several categories of work. Those categories were grouped by type of work (homework assignment, quiz, midterm, final, paper, etc.), not by topic. As a result, student performance was clouded by a haze of numbers and formulas, and their questions to me about their performance as well as my answers were, as a result, continually passed through a filters of numbers, formulas, and mathematically (im)possible scenarios. 

This semester, however, I have done away with the semester average as final grade. Instead, each of my music theory and aural skills classes has a list of about a dozen course objectives, each of which get their own grade (a number from 0 to 4, with 3 or higher constituting passing). Students must achieve passing knowledge of every course objective topic to pass the course. I should also note that the score for each category is based on most recent work. Early scores help the student know if their on track to finish well, but only the late scores matter for their final grade. (I'm not worried about average performance; I'm worried about where they end up, and I want to use grades early on to help get them where I want them by the end.)

The other change that this system necessitates is that assignments rarely receive a single grade. For instance, a keyboard-style voice-leading assignment may receive grades in voice-leading, functional-bass labels, harmonic syntax analysis, cadences (recognizing and realizing), and notation software (typesetting all of the above elements).

I made the decision to adopt this system for a few reasons. 

First, each of my courses are part of a sequence (Music Theory I–IV, Aural Skills I–IV), and the prerequisite for taking each course is passing the previous course in the sequence (in both sequences actually—Theory III requires passing Theory II and Aural Skills II). It only makes sense that passing one course should require being prepared for the next one, and that means having at least working knowledge, if not mastery, of a number of skills and knowledge categories. 

Second (and related), the group of students with passing averages in a semester and the group of students ready to take the next level of the course sequence have turned out not always to be the same. That is, some students do well enough in some parts of the course to cancel out poor performance in other parts, leading to a passing average even though they struggle with something that is key for succeeding in the next semester. Conversely, other students have bloomed late or simply skipped a large enough number of homework assignments that their average performance for the semester is poor, though the ace the final exams. This leads to a number of specific students in each class whose average score does not reflect their readiness to move on or their mastery of the materials listed as course objectives on the syllabus.

Third, I've come to the conclusion more abstractly that "final" grade and "average" grade (even a weighted one) need not, and should not be the same thing. I don't want to penalize students for understanding the material late, and that's what using an average grade for an overall grade does. Instead, I use early grades largely to tell students how on track they are to finish where they need to finish. If they master a topic early, great! If they get it at the last second, awesome! I simply want to make sure they get what they need by the end of the semester, so that they are ready to move on with the course sequence and/or their musical careers. Thus from both practical and philosophical perspectives, I've decided against the practice of using some sort of average grade as the final grade.

Lastly, I simply got tired of students asking 1) what their average was, 2) what score do they need on the next assignment/quiz/exam to pull the average up to a desired number, and only occasionally proceeding to 3) what specifically do they need to study to achieve that score. (That's not to mention all the questions about "extra credit" from students who never did the regular credit work.)

Since moving to criteria-referenced grading this semester, here are a few things I've noticed.





  * Students rarely ask how their marks translate into a letter grade.  
  * Students ask me directly about their performance in specific areas (e.g., "My voice-leading grade is still failing; what am I missing that I need in order to bring it up?")  
  * Students are much more eager than in the past to redo poor assignments.  
  * When students come to see me, I don't need to look at their graded assignments (which they don't keep with them) to see what we need to address in that meeting.  
  * I can track overall class performance in specific areas easily, and adjust my teaching plan if necessary (taking an extra day for topic x, and skipping that day practicing the topic that everyone is nailing).  
  * Several students have adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy, picking off one failing topic at a time until they have it down—and it works.  
  * Students are not writing off the area that's the biggest struggle this semester (voice-leading) like they did last semester (timed interval quizzes)—because it's not the difference between an A and a B or a B and a C, it's the difference between an A, B, or C and an F.  
  * Even the students who just look at their grade(s) and put the assignment away without reviewing my comments have a good idea what they did well and what they need to improve.



Time will tell how things turn out as a result, but it looks promising—well, promising for the quality of knowledge passing students will come away with, and promising for the quality of class we'll have next semester with these same students, but maybe a little less so for the number of students that make it through. I also have some thoughts on how to improve the system for next year, but I'll save those for another post.

Do any out there have thoughts about such a system, or have you used it yourself?
