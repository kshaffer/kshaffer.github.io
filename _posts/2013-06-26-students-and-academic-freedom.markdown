Last night's [\#profchat](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23profchat&amp;src=hash) discussion was about academic freedom in the classroom. Often, academic freedom is associated with research, but we wanted to discuss what role it played in pedagogical decisions relating to content, presentation, assignments, student activity, as well as what freedom instructors have when teaching one of several sections of a course, or one course in a sequence.

In the middle of this chat, Kate Owens asked an insightful question, one which often does not come up regarding academic freedom:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>A3, or maybe related Q3? I wonder how my/our/the (undergraduate) students would define academic freedom. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23profchat&amp;src=hash">#profchat</a></p>&mdash; Kate Owens (@katemath) <a href="https://twitter.com/katemath/statuses/349684310472785923">June 26, 2013</a></blockquote>

I decided to ask a few of my former students (all from CSU) whom I had seen tweeting recently what they thought.

Here are the responses that came in.

The one thing missing from all of these responses is faculty *research*. Granted, they are all students at a teaching university (and who have experienced at least a year in an "inverted" class). However, I find it significant that after a discussion of whether non-tenured professors (or adjuncts or graduate students) have academic freedom, the students responded with no hint of the idea that academic freedom only applied to faculty.

And why should it? Students need to learn how to promote freedom and use it wisely. Having a degree of ownership over the educational process often leads to better long-term learning (and love of the process). And since *schola* (school) literally means "leisure," shouldn't the academy be a space in which students have the time, freedom, and support to contemplate the true and the good as they grow their intellect as individuals and a community?

I'm glad we had this discussion and got some students involved. Academic freedom is incredibly important, but I'm often self-centered about it, standing up for my freedom and that of my faculty colleagues. However, academic freedom is important for student development as well, and I need to defend that freedom just as vigorously. The first, and deepest, way I can do that is by designing courses (and grading policies!) that both provide freedom of expression and activity to students *and* give them appropriate limits in which to develop *safely* the discipline of free thinking and acting.
