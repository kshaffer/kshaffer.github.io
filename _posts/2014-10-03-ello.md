[Has Ello already blown it?](https://medium.com/@stevejennings1/has-ello-already-blown-it-3763a3d3b1fe) is an interesting take on Ello—and any other "free as in beer (but not as in freedom)" services. The problems raised here are important ones for ed-tech too, perhaps more so.

The main issue raised here is that Ello's product is not the service, their product is their user base. And they are not selling to their users, they are selling to their investors. The same is true for every free, VC-backed service online. *If you don't pay for it (and sometimes, even if you do), you're the product—not the customer.*

And if we as teachers require our students to use free services, we aren't just leading them to a useful service. We are coercing them into becoming someone else's product.

As an educator who likes to try out all the new stuff, this realization has been big for me these past few months. I have to be careful the services I use, and even more so, the services I require my students to use.

So as much as possible, I'm sticking to services that CU supports (mainly Google Drive) and things that I control myself. And I'm not joining Ello.
