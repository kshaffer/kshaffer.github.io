[Pete Rorabaugh](https://twitter.com/allistelling) (one of my heroes) gives a great introduction to Twitter for academics. Twitter is a stream. You are a bear. Tweets are fish. As you stand in the stream, you're going to get pummeled by water, and many fish will pass you by. That's okay. You only need to find a few good ones.

I love this analogy. However, Twitter is changing. And while I sympathize with a new user being overwhelmed at all the information passing them by, and I've certainly felt that myself lately, the new problems with Twitter are more sinister.

As usual, I first noticed the technical problem. Twitter, the company, is now experimenting with using an algorithm in Twitter, the platform, that affects what I see in my home feed from Twitter, the community. This, as many have noted, diminishes its unique value for many Twitter users. And to people like me who have at least one foot in the open-source community, this serves as a stark reminder that we do not control what we write or what we read on Twitter—not as individuals, and not as a community.

The problem is made far more poignant in light of recent news about prominent Twitter users, mostly women, who have been the target of hate speech, harassment, and threats of violence—in most cases simply because of critiques they published about systemic sexism and other issues of social justice in the tech industry (especially gaming). And as I've seen Twitter's (non-)response to this violence, I've come to the conclusion that Twitter as a platform makes it easier for hate groups to succeed in harassing users than for individuals to avoid such harassment, or even to report it. 

What it boils down to is this: for better or for worse, *the decision making employees of Twitter are defining members of my online community.* Their decisions have a significant impact on who is part of my community, how we communicate, and whether or not we even hear what each other has to say. And their decisions have meant that some really awful people have been able to invade that community, and in some cases they have done some real damage.

So what are we to do when we find that the platform upon which our community depends is doing harm to the community? (or, at least, making it too easy for others to do harm) I don't have any calls to action. :) But I have made a few realizations lately that are framing the way I'm thinking about these issues.

1. First, the members of Twitter, the company, are core members of our Twitter community.  
2. Because of that, the platform is not neutral. And we have very little control over that platform on which we have come to depend.  
3. Our Twitter community is not *a* community. It is a complex network of distinct, but overlapping and interconnected communities. Even *my* network is a mesh of different communities. That makes jumping ship a very complicated option if we want to preserve the good things about Twitter on a new platform, either as individuals or as a group. (And Twitter, and Facebook, know that.)  
4. And because of all these things, it will be impossible to get back the good of Twitter Past, either on Twitter or in a new place.

In light of these realizations, I'm still mulling over what I might do in response. I want to keep as much of the good of Twitter as I can, but I definitely would prefer to own my own space and use my own tools for following others. Of course, I have a blog. But as great as blogs are for the long form, I really like the fast-paced, short-form nature of Twitter for other kinds of discourse. So I'll keep playing around with [Known](http://krisshaffer.withknown.com), and experiment with ways to work around Twitter's platform issues—"following" people via lists instead of the timeline, for example. 

And who knows? Maybe I'll find a sweet way to jump into that stream and catch some tasty salmon.
