We will be hosting an unconference on the inverted music theory class at Charleston Southern this summer. FlipCamp Music Theory will take place June 17–18. [The website is up](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com), and registration is open, so check it out!

Though the unconference is focused on music theory pedagogy, we'd be glad to have professors, instructors, or grad students from any musical discipline interested in music pedagogy in higher ed.
