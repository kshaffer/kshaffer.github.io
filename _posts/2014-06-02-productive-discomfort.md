I'm giving a keynote address tomorrow morning at the University of Delaware Summer Faculty Institute, titled "Productive Discomfort: Fostering Learning in an Inquiry-Driven Class." It will be followed by a workshop on what I call "rigorous play" in a university class.

I'll post my slides (and a video feed, if available) after the presentation. For now, though, here are a few teaser quotes. Most of these come from other scholars that I will be citing. A couple are my own.

"Best Practices are snake oil." -Jesse Stommel

"Play is, in brief, serious business." -Adeline Koh

"Play is critical inquiry." -Jesse Stommel, Sean Michael Morris, and Pete Rorabaugh

"Learning content makes the unfamiliar familiar. Learning how to learn makes unfamiliarity familiar." -Kris Shaffer

"When we improve our pedagogical methods without also reassessing our pedagogical goals, we run the risk of getting really good at doing something bad, or at least irrelevant." -Kris Shaffer

"What agency can you give your students?" -Kris Shaffer
