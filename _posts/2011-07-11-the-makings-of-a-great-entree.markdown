It was my job to cook dinner yesterday. We scheduled BLTs and corn on the cob. Very yummy. However, we'd already packed our cookie sheets, making it difficult to cook nine strips of savory bacon at once. My wife suggested a glass baking dish (heretofore referred to as the glass bacon dish), and it worked perfectly. Note how the bacon generously coats the entire bottom of the pan.

I thought to myself, "This looks like the beginnings of an amazing dish!" If only I had a recipe that began, _step 1: thoroughly coat the bottom of a standard baking dish with bacon_. That's where this post comes in. Surely one of my readers (and I do have one particular reader in mind; you know who you are!) will be able to help me complete the recipe in a tasty, and not necessarily healthy, way.

So, your suggestions?
